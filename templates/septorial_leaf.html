            <p>
              Septoria leaf spot is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici.
              This fungus can attack tomatoes at any stage of development, but
              symptoms usually first appear on the older, lower leaves and stems
              when plants are setting fruit. Symptoms usually appear on leaves,
              but can occur on petioles, stems, and the calyx.

              <h4>Symptoms</h4>
              <p>
                The first symptoms appear as small, water-soaked, circular spots
                1/16 to 1/8" in diameter on the undersides of older leaves. The
                centers of these spots then turn gray to tan and have a
                dark-brown margin.

              <h4>Causes</h4>
              <p>
                Septoria is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici, which
                overwinters in old tomato debris and on wild Solanaceous plants.

              <h4>Control and Treatment</h4>
              <p>
                Fungicides are very effective for control of Septoria leaf spot
                and applications are often necessary to supplement the control
                strategies previously outlined.
